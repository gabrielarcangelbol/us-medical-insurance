# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs Analysis

## Project Overview

For this project, you will be investigating a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills that you have developed. This dataset and its parameters will seem familiar if you have done any of the previous Python projects in the data science path. However, you are now tasked with working with the actual information in the dataset and performing your own independent analysis on real-world data! We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do, but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis.

## Example Project
Example U.S. Medical Insurance Costs Project

## Project Objectives:
- Work locally on your own computer
- Import a dataset into your program
- Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods
- Use libraries to assist in your analysis
- Optional: Document and organize your findings
- Optional: Make predictions about a dataset’s features based on your findings

## Prerequisites:
- Python Fundamentals
- If you know Python libraries or skills that extend beyond this expectation (such as NumPy or pandas), you are encouraged to use them. This project is meant for you to show off your knowledge, so do not feel constrained by the tasks or hints written out.

Note that `us-medical-insurance-costs.ipynb` is a blank file and should be used to create your project.

## Going off platform:
You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer. For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor or Jupyter Notebook.
- Command Line Interface Setup
- Introducing Jupyter Notebook
- Setting up Jupyter Notebook
- Getting Started with Jupyter
- Getting More out of Jupyter Notebook

## Debugging Tips:
Feeling stuck? Try the following:
- Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how other folks have found solutions.
- Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any libraries that you are using. Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
- Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.

Remember: your project doesn’t have to look anything like this! It should be unique to your vision.
